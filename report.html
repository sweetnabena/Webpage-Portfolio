    <h4 class="first-sec" id="first-sec">TOP THREE CHALLENGES DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
      <div class="number-list"><span>1</span><h3>Challenge 1</h3>
      </div>
        <p class="report-decription"> One challenge that I faced during the implementation of the résumé process was getting familiar with the language, as this was my first official project using a language I was unfamiliar with I found that my attempt to start this project was a lot slower and long-winded. Additionally, I found it hard to understand the design specifications that were instructed of me having little to no knowledge on the implementation of HTML and CSS prior to this, I found that I overlooked and overcomplicated certain sections that were more straightforward than I initially expected. </p>
        <div class="number-list"><h3>Challenge 2</h3></div>
        <p class="report-description">Additionally, I struggled with finding suitable spacing that suited the model design. Particularly when using the padding-bottom/top as well as margin CSS properties whilst completing this assignment. In situations where I had to improvise the padding and margin sizing elements to fit the website design, I found it quite difficult to be flexible. This is because I struggled to differentiate the functionalities of these property elements specifically the margin and padding elements on a lot of occasions which was rather frustrating. </p>
        <div class="number-list"><h3>Challenge 3</h3></div>
        <p class="report-description"> Time management- Lastly, I struggled with managing my time efficiently. Having experienced some difficulty at the start of my assignment served as a setback in the pacing of my assignment, I found myself taking longer than I intended on certain tasks I had planned for myself prior to completing them. This means that my assignment completion took longer than expected and I found myself rushing and getting overwhelmed by how hefty the tasks seemed when tackling them. This made the process more exhausting than it was when I had just started. </p>
   <h4 class="second-sec">HOW I MANAGED THE CHALLENGES</h4>
       <div class="number-list"><h3>Challenge 1</h3></div>
        <p>To tackle this, I sought out online resources as well as consulted with my subject tutor for further support. This really helped as the uncertainties I experienced whilst starting my project were quickly resolved. Consulting with my subject tutor geared me on the right path on how to approach this project as all uncertainties I had were quickly resolved and clarified. This support gave me the confidence to give my project a different approach which led to its successful completion. Online resources also supported this, turning to these resources helped me familiarise myself with various concepts of HTML and its CSS attributes for example, when looking for the CSS properties for designing a button. This boosted my confidence level when approaching similar problems moving forward as I was able to distinguish a pattern that enhanced and quickened the learning process. </p>
        <div class="number-list"><h3>Challenge 2</h3></div>
        <p>Further, I was able to resolve this issue by incorporating trial and error, allowing myself to try values and measuring styles (i.e. em, px) helped to distinguish which styles best suited whatever design I was trying to adjust to suit the model. It also helped me get comfortable with using various elements involved with HTML and CSS design properties. This was aided through the use of online resources as well, through this I find out the differences between the padding and margin elements and how to best utilise them in accordance with various section elements within this assignment. Solely relying on trial and error would have led to a prolonged delay in the design process so making use of external resources served as a time conserver and also helped me to familiarise myself with these concepts. On top of that, I took part in courses on how-to's involving HTML and CSS for a period of time before starting my project, this made it easier for me to establish keywords associated with this language when addressing any research inquiries I may have encountered throughout the duration of the implementation process of the résumé. </p>
        <div class="number-list"><h3>Challenge 3</h3></div>
        <p>I found that asking my subject tutor for help on areas that needed clarification gave me a clear view of my next steps, this helped me to remain organised as I realised that my time efficiency worsened during times of skepticism and ambiguity. As well as this, spreading out my workload using a timetable (more often checklist) across a period of time/daily allowed me to complete mini tasks which reduced the overwhelming nature that I had associated with the assignment which would have delayed its completion if left unaddressed. This helped make the process more enjoyable and motivated me to accomplish more than what was intended. Lastly, I encouraged myself to find this project more of a fun task rather than an encumbering one by keeping myself interested in the design attributes of a website, I achieved this by watching YouTube tutorials whilst utilising a variety of online resources that were available to me. </p>
      
    <h4 class="third-sec">TOP THREE THINGS LEARNED DURING IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
      <ol>
        <li> <p>One thing I have learned during the implementation of the résumé is the deep intricacy involved when designing software programmes such as websites and apps. This has led me to develop a key eye for detail when designing the various sections of this project. Through this, I developed problem-solving skills as well as the ability to identify areas that did not align with the initial model and also provided the drive to seek out effective solutions to those problems whilst maintaining time efficiency and organisation. </li> </p>
        <li><p>Consequently, I was able to develop my research skills as a result, being initially unfamiliar with the language used in this assignment prompted me to seek out tutorials and useful tips through a variety of resources in order to complete this assignment successfully. This widened the scope of my research field as I discovered various methods to tackle the issues I encountered both online and offline that can also be applied to further projects moving onwards. I was also able to enhance my range of technological jargon through this which has boosted my confidence levels in progressing in academic research within the technological field. </li> </p>
        <li> <p>Lastly, I was able to use this opportunity to expand my programming knowledge, being given the opportunity to get a head-start on how to go about learning a new language independently, prepared me for skills I will need moving on to further education at university. This will better enhance my learning experience as I am likely to better deal with setbacks that come with venturing out into technological prospects in the future as I am more likely to be able to handle high amounts of pressure that is associated with meeting deadlines. I was also able to develop my communication skills, whilst interacting with my subject tutor I learned to be able to express my thoughts during periods of uncertainty and confusion and seek out help when need be whilst maintaining independence when conducting my research. This attribute aided in the completion of the assignment as I was able to address and receive advice on how I can improve and enhance my work as well as gaining knowledge on the most effective ways to do so. </li></p>
